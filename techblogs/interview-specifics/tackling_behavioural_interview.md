# Tackling Behavioural Interview

###### Why Prepare ?

- It's not easy to talk about ourself and our experiences in a way that comes naturally without studying or refreshing beforehand. 
- However, what we need to remember is that interviews can  be stressful and stress produces negative side-effects like sweating,  awkward body movements and blank minds.
- In such situations, our brain spends valuable processing time on keeping us calm and appearing professional which means that there is less brain capacity for retrieving memories and stringing words together in an intelligent way.
- Without enough preparation we may end up rambling or sharing incoherent examples.
