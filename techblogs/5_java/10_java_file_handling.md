# File Handling in Java

###### Why File Handling is needed ?

- So far the operations using Java programs are done on a  prompt/terminal which is not stored anywhere.
- But in the software  industry, most of the programs are written to store the information  fetched from the program.
- One such way is to store the fetched  information in a **file**. 



###### What is File Handling in Java ?

- A **file** is a container which is used to store various types of information.
- Data is permanently stored in secondary memory by creating a file with a unique name. 
- A file may consist of text, image  or any other document. 



###### Operations performed on a file :

1. Creation of a new file
2. Opening an existing file
3. Reading from file
4. Writing to a file
5. Moving to a specific location in a file
6. Closing a file
