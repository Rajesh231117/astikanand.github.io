# Multi-threading in Java

##### Multi-tasking

- Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
- We use multitasking to utilize the CPU.
- Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:
  1. [Process-based Multi-tasking (Multi-processing)]()
     - Each process has an address in memory, in other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
     - A process is heavyweight.
     - Cost of communication between the process is high.
     - Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists, etc.
  2. [Thread-based Multi-tasking (Multi-threading)]()
     - Threads share the same address space.
     - A thread is lightweight.
     - Cost of communication between the thread is low.

###### What is Multi-threading ?

- Multithreading is a feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
- Each part of such program is called a thread. 
- So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

###### What are threads ?

- A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing.
- It has a separate path of execution.
- Threads are independent, if there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. 
- It uses a shared memory area.

###### How to create threads ?

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :

1. Extending the **Thread class**
2. Implementing the **Runnable Interface**



### 1. Extending the Thread Class

- We create a class that extends the **java.lang.Thread**  class.
- This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread  class.
- A thread begins its life inside run() method. 
- We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a  thread.
- Start()  invokes the run() method on the Thread object.



```java
// Java code for thread creation by extending the Thread class 
class MultithreadingDemo extends Thread { 
    public void run() { 
        try { 
            // Displaying the thread that is running 
            System.out.println ("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running"); 
        } 
        catch (Exception e) { 
            // Throwing an exception 
            System.out.println ("Exception is caught"); 
        } 
    } 
} 
  
// Main Class 
public class Multithread { 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 8; // Number of threads 
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { 
            MultithreadingDemo object = new MultithreadingDemo(); 
            object.start(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

**Output:**

```
Thread 8 is running
Thread 9 is running
Thread 10 is running
Thread 11 is running
Thread 12 is running
Thread 13 is running
Thread 14 is running
Thread 15 is running
```



### 2. Implementing the Runnable Interface

- We create a new class which implements java.lang.Runnable interface and  override run() method.
- Then we instantiate a Thread object and call  start() method on this object.



```java
// Java code for thread creation by implementing the Runnable Interface 
class MultithreadingDemo implements Runnable { 
    public void run() { 
        try { 
            // Displaying the thread that is running 
            System.out.println ("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running"); 
        } 
        catch (Exception e) { 
            // Throwing an exception 
            System.out.println ("Exception is caught"); 
        } 
    } 
} 
  
// Main Class 
class Multithread { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int n = 8; // Number of threads 
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { 
            Thread object = new Thread(new MultithreadingDemo()); 
            object.start(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

**Output:**

```
Thread 8 is running
Thread 9 is running
Thread 10 is running
Thread 11 is running
Thread 12 is running
Thread 13 is running
Thread 14 is running
Thread 15 is running
```





##### Thread Class vs. Runnable Interface

1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other  class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we  implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base  classes.

2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread  class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt()  etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
