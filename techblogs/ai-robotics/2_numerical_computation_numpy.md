# Numerical Computation - NumPy

###### What is Numpy ?

- It is a highly optimized library for numerical operations.
- Array structures are important coz digital images are 2D arrays of P-I-X-E-L-S.
- All the OpenCV array structres are converted from Numpy Arrays.
- We can use more convenient indexing system rather than using for loops.
