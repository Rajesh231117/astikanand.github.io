- The coins were issued west of Indus only though their empire included Gangetic basin as well. 
- For day-to-day transactions, there were copper and lead coins.

The standardization of the coins also shows that the monetization had penetrated deep enough among in the economy.
- In one set of coins his name is written in Greek while in the other in Persian script. In his gold coins, the obverse has his own image while the reverse has the image of a god / goddess.

It also shows that Sivaism was the most popular religion in that region along with Buddhism.
- The use of Bactrian language in his coins indicates that Bactria was the centre of his empire. 



### Gupta Coins

###### Characteristics 

- The Guptas issued large number of gold coins called dinar. The obverse generally had a representation of the king and reverse a deity.
- The silver coins had the king on the obverse and a motif (garuda) on the reverse. Copper coins are rare.    

###### Significance

- Earliest coins have been found in UP indicating UP was the beginning site of the Guptas. Some coins of a prince Kacha after CG-1 have been found indicating SG had a political adversary who he eliminated.
- Gupta coins throw light on the military trends of the age. Horsemen are shown on the coins, not chariots or elephants. This shows that horsemen were increasing in importance and chariots and elephants decreasing.  
- Garuda indicates mark of Vishnu. Images of durga and laxmi on the coins indicate shakti worship was becoming popular. Ashvamedha coins indicate prevalence of brahmanical rituals among the ruling class to claim legitimacy. These coins also throw light on script of the age and are pieces of miniature art.
- Gupta gold coins were 10g each and were found only in urban centers and along the trade routes thus indicating they were not used by commoners. Gupta copper coins are very few (no copper coins have been recovered before CG II except Ramgupta and even after that they remain rare), which suggest the depth of monetization of economy was very shallow. Coins were not used in day-to-day transactions by common people. Even the literature tells us gold coins were used by the big merchants in big transactions and commoners used barter or shells or copper powder (Fa-Hein). The coins were also getting debased towards the later years of the empire. LR was also paid in kind indicating monetization was not high.
- They show the qualities expected of a ruler - warrior, brave, sacrifices and protector of social order, patron of art.  
- CG I's coin show him with his Licchavi wife indicating Licchavis were still an important political force. His coins were the first to have the title *maharajadhiraja* indicating he was the first important ruler. It also indicates the feudal nature of polity. 
- SG's coins tell us he was an illustrious warrior. His coins mention that he performed  ashvamedha yajna and was invincible. SG's coins show him in various poses - indicating various qualities he possessed or claimed to possess. Archer type coin, battle-axe type, killing a tiger, ashvamedha type, standard type (he holds a staff and performs a sacrifice), veena type. The tiger type coins show he had conquered Bengal since tigers are only found there. His title in the coins also indicates his conquests.
- CG II's coins contain the titles - *param*-*bhagvata* (which tells us about his being vaishnavite and the divine association of kingship) and *vikramaditya*. This tells us he was a vaishnavite and defeated a foreign ruler, possibly Saka. His silver coins also tell us that he defeated the sakas because silver coins were circulated by Sakas only.
- Kumargupta's peacock coins indicate he was a follower of *Kartikeya*. His coins also show him performing ashvamedha yajna.
- Skandagupta also uses the title *vikramaditya* indicating he defeated the Huns.
- These coins tell us about the metallurgical skills, level of prosperity and indication of monetization in the economy. They were also called *dinars* indicating Roman trade links. Many Gupta coins have been found in hoards and some are in mint condition which (together with their aesthetic beauty) led some scholars to believe that they were meant for presentation only and not circulation. But obviously this was not the case.
