## Indus Valley Civilization (2500 BC – 1750 BC)

###### Discovery

-  In 1921, archaeologists **John Marshall** & **Dayaram Sahni** excavated a site **Harappa**, on the banks of river Rabi in Punjab region of Pakistan.
- **Mohenjo-Daro**, another important site of Indus Valley civilization was discovered in Sindh region of Pakistan on the banks of river Indus.
- Due to the similarities in town planning and seals it was confirmed that both were part of same civilization.
- Harappan Civilization was named after Harappa which was the first site discovered.
- Also most of the sites discovered were on the banks of river Indus thus the name **Indus Valley civilization**.

- ***There are two criteria for civilization is:***
  1. It must have cities.
  2. It must have its own script
- ***Harappan Script:***
  - Harappan scripts were found on its seals and it is pictographic.
  - It is boustrophedon style.
  - Harappan Script is closet to Dravidian script of Munda tribe of Jharkhand.

> [Boustrophedon]() – is a kind of bi-directional text, mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. Every other line of writing is flipped or reversed, with reversed letters. Rather than going left-to-right as in modern English or right-to-left as in Arabic and Hebrew, alternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored.

###### Origin of Civilization

- ***As given by Western historians :***
  - They considered this civilization as an offshoot of **Mesopotamian** or **Byzantinian** civilization and that it originated suddenly.
  - Drawback of this theory is that there is no evidence supporting it.
  - Also Mesopotamian civilisation’s findings were different than those of the Harappan civilisation.
- ***As given by Indian historians :***
  - The civilisation gradually developed and it had indigenous origin.
  - It evolved from the Neolithic period where agriculture was practised and surplus grains produced were traded.

  2. **Lower Town** – was used by ruled class.

#### Decline of Indus Valley Civilization

There are multiple theories proposed by various scholars which explain the decline of this civilization.

- ***Theory by Mortimer Wheeler :***
  - This theory suggested that attack by the Aryans was responsible for the decline.
  - The main drawback of this theory was that it is confirmed that Aryans came to India around 1500 BC whereas Harappan civilization ended by 1750 BC.
- ***Theory by Riggs :***
  - He proposed that the civilization declined due to earthquake which was followed by floods.
  - Evidences of floods have been found in Mohenjo-Daro.
  - The main drawback of this theory was that this theory is confined only to certain regions of Harappan civilization and not to all the places where the civilization flourished.
- ***Theory by Fariservis :***
  - He proposed that ecological imbalance was responsible for decline of the civilization.
  - But failed to provide satisfactory data to prove his theory.
- ***Theory by Das and Sood :***
  - They proposed that change in course of Indus River was the reason for decline of the civilization and as most of the cities were on the banks of river Indus, thus civilization was destroyed.
- ***Theory by Malik and Pochal :***
  - They argued that Harappan civilization was not completely destroyed and there was a link between Harappan and post-Harappan culture but the uniformity of the civilization ended.
